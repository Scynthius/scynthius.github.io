                            Web app developed with Node.js, Passport.js, Handlebars, Bootstrap, jQuery, SQL, and MariaDB. I
                            acted as Scrum Master for the project team of 4 other students, managing user stories, deadlines, and
                            approvals using Asana. The app allows new users to create an account and select from a list of
                            prefabricated Task Timers or create custom tasks and categories. Tasks are added to the user’s
                            queue and play a user-uploaded jingle upon reaching the end. After a preselected break timer, the
                            next task in the queue begins automatically. The application stores historical performance
                            information and provides a graphical interface for users to review daily activities organized by
                            various criteria such as category, task, or date.
